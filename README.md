# Chess, made in Haskell
Literally made because I was bored.

Pawns can move as if they where in their initial position. This is intentional.

# Install
Run
```console
$ ghc -dynamic Main.hs Chess.hs Control.hs
```

You'll need the System.Console.ANSI package however, which I is why I should propably have made this with cabal.
